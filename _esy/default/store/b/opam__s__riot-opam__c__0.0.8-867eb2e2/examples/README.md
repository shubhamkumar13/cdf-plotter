# Learning by Example

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ Excited to have you here. Riot's examples serve as a tutorial for
building libraries and applications. Each example is a small complete project,
with its own README, and next steps to take.

You can start at [./1-hello-world](./1-hello-world) and work your way up.

* [1-hello-world](./1-hello-world) â€“ a small program to get you started
* [2-spawn-process](./2-spawn-process) - creating your first process
* [3-message-passing](./3-message-passing) - sending a message to a process
* [4-long-lived-processes](./4-long-lived-processes) - creating a process that runs forever
* [5-links-and-monitors](./5-links-and-monitors/) - getting to know when a process terminates

### Coming Up

The following tutorials are in the works:

* [6-supervisors](./6-supervisors/) - how to keep processes alive
* [7-supervision-trees](./7-supervision-trees/) - using supervisors to structure work
* [8-applications](./8-applications/) - packaging an application
* [9-logger](./9-logger) - using the built-in Logger

And in future releases, as new work is done on the runtime and the Riot
standard libraries, we'll be covering more topics such as:

* Gen servers
* Agents
* Binary-string matching
* Best-practices around typing messages 
* Application-level tracing
