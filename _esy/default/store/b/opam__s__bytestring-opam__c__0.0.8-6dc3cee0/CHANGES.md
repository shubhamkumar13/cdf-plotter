# Changes

## 0.0.8

This is the largest Riot release yet, and we are splitting the package into 4 sub-packages:

* the Riot runtime+library
* Bytestring ‚Äì efficient and ergonomic bytestring manipulation
* Gluon ‚Äì a low-level, efficient async I/O engine 
* Rio ‚Äì composable I/O streams for vectored operations 

### Riot Runtime

* Improved performance and memory usage by creating 95% smaller processes,
  ensuring fibers are always properly discontinued to release their resources,
  and moving to Weak references for processes to ensure they get garbage
  collected timely.

* Introduce Process Priorities ‚Äì the scheduler has been improved to support
  processes with different priorities (High, Normal, and Low). Thanks
  @LeedsJohn for the contribution! üëè

* Introduce `receive` Timeouts ‚Äì you can now call `receive ~after:10L ()` and
  if there are messages fetched in 10 microseconds `receive` will raise a
  `Receive_timeout` exception that you can match on.

* Introduce `syscall` Timeouts ‚Äì any syscall being made now can specify a
  timeout for an answer. If the syscall isn't ready to retry within the timeout
  period, a `Syscall_timeout` exception will be raised.

* Improve `Timer_wheel` with support for clearing timers, iterating timers
  in the order in which they were created, and a MinHeap backend.

### Riot Lib

* New `Dynamic_supervisor` to dynamically allocate pools of processes up to a
  maximum.

* New `Runtime.Stats` server can be started to periodically print out
  statistics about the runtime and the garbage collector.

* The `Net.Socket` module is now split into a `Tcp_listener` and a
  `Tcp_stream`, with their corresponding functions for listening, connecting,
  sending, and receiving. These also include support for timeouts.

* New File and File Descriptor operations for seeking. Thanks to @diogomqbm! üëè

* Introduce SSL module to turn sockets into SSL-backed Reader/Writer streams.
  This includes making a `Net.Socket.stream_socket` into a client or a server
  SSL-backed stream pair.

* Introduce `Task` to quickly spin up processes that we can await. This is the
  closest we have to a future. A `Task` is typed, executes a single function, 
  and MUST be awaited with `Task.await ?timeout task`.

* Introduce `Crypto.Random` module with high-level utilities for creating
  random data of different types, including integers of different sizes,
  strings, bytestrings, bytes, characters, and ASCII strings.

* Introduce new named pid functions `Process.where_is` and `Porcess.await_name`
  to make it easier to find pids by name, and await a name to be registered.

* New `Process.is_alive` predicate to check if a process is alive

* Improve logging on most modules with namespaces

* Initializing the Riot runtime twice results in a runtime exception ‚Äì thanks
  @julien-leclercq for the contribution! üëè

* Introduce `Ref.cast` to do type-safe type-casting based on runtime
  information of a Ref at its instantiation time.

* Introduce a `Stream` module that extends the stdlib Seq with a `reduce_while` combinator.

* Introduce inmemory key-value `Store` that works in a process-friendly
  fashion, similar to Erlang's ETS.

### Bytestring

* First implementation of efficient immutable byte strings with cheap view and
  concat operations. Thanks to @felipecrv for contributing! üëè

* Iterators and Transient builders for efficiently examining, destructuring,
  and constructing byte strings from different sources.

* Preliminary Bytestrings syntax support (via a ppx) for constructions and
  efficient pattern matching using the `%b` sigil.

### Gluon

* First implementation of an efficient, low-level async I/O engine inspired by
  Rust's Mio. Gluon uses an opaque Token based approach that lets you directly
  reference an OCaml value as part of the polled events from the underlying
  async engine. Thanks to @diogomqbm and @emilpriver for contributing! üëè

* Preliminary support for epoll on Linux and kqueue on macOS with conditional
  compilation via the `config` package.

### Rio

* First implementation of composable I/O streams via a Read/Write interface
  inspired by Rust's Read/Write traits.

## 0.0.7

* Introduce IO module with low-level IO operations such as performing direct
  vectorized (or regular) reads/writes. New operations include:
  * `read`, `write`
  * `single_read`, `single_write` (vectorized)
  * `await_readable`, `await_writeable`, `await`
  * `write_all`
  * `copy` and `copy_buffered`

* Introduce Buffer module with support for converting from and to CStruct and
  String, including position tracking.

* Introduce Read/Reader interface for creating buffered and unbuffered readers
  of arbitrary sources.

* Introduce Write/Writer interfaces for creating unbuffered writers into
  arbitrary destinations/sinks.

* Introduce File module with Reader and Writer implementations

* Implment Reader and Writer interfaces for Net.Socket

* Dropped dependency on Bigstringaf and moved to Cstruct

* Fix max number of domains to always be under the recommended domain count

* Fix issue with tests where the runtime idled after the main would die. Now
  the main process finishing with an exception is considered reason enough to
  shutdown the system.

* Refactor tests to always output `test_name: OK` when everything is fine and
  all modules to end in `_test`.

* Add several IO tests.

* Fix log levels for writing to sockets

* Include proper license for C Stubs copied from `lib_eio_posix` for vectorized i/o.

* Split test suite into io/non-io so io tests are left outside opam ci

* Improved IO polling that removes heavy iterations over process/fds tables

* Rewrite Dashmap internals to use a Hashtbl


## 0.0.6

* Redo packaging to expose a single public library: `riot`
* Fix issue with schedulers busy-waiting
* Introduce separate IO Schedulers for polling
* Switch to `poll` to support kqueue on macOS
* Reuse read-buffers on Rio.read loops
* Broaden IO socket types to file descriptors
* Improved polling with shorter poll timeouts and safety checks
* Add `Dashmap.iter` to iterate over a collection
* Add `net_test` with an echo tcp server/client
* Fix bugs with syscall suspension that was introduced with reduction counting


## 0.0.5

* Add `register name pid`
* Add `unregister name`
* Add `send_by_name ~name msg`
* Fix timer wheel making it remove timers correctly
* Add better test for `Timer.send_after`

## 0.0.4

* Internally immediately suspend (bypassing reduction counts) when on a receive expression
* Fix reads from closed Unix sockets
* Fix writes to closed Unix sockets
* Ignore SIGPIPEs on setup
* Fix always mark connected sockets as nonblocking 
* Fix GC i/o process table
* Surface pretty-printing of socket values 

## 0.0.3

* Big namespace refactor. `Riot.Runtime` includes the lower-level runtime
  blocks, and everything else that is more user-friendly lives at the `Riot.*`
level.
* Introduce reduction counting, so processes will run up to N iterations unless
  they finish, or they execute an unhandled effect.
* Introduce the `Application` interface for managing the lifecycle of the system
* Fix `Riot.Logger` to fit the `Application` interface
* Add a new `Riot.Telemetry` backend for doing async telemetry

## 0.0.2

* New `Riot.random ()` API to expose current scheduler's random state
* Better logging in the `Net` module
* Fix a bug where `Net.Socket` operations where hanging on I/O polling when they could have been eager

## 0.0.1

First release, including:

* First working version of the scheduler
* Support for process spawning, message passing, monitoring, and linking
* Rudimentary supervisors
* Basic (and incomplete) GenServer
* Scheduling-aware I/O primitives
* Scheduling-aware Logger
* Timers
