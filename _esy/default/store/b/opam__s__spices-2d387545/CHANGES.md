  fixes, and includes new microsecond resolution timers.

## 0.0.2

#### Mint Tea

* Add support for custom events ‚Äì any Riot message sent to a Mint Tea app will
  become an `Event.Custom msg` event, which enables sending data into TUIs from
  other processes.

* Add `key` type for key down events ‚Äì this means we now get better
  discoverability of what key down events we can match on, and its easier to
  keep examples working

* Capture more key events: arrows (left,down,up,right), backspace, space,
  enter, escape.

* Move `initial_state` to the application start invocation ‚Äì you can now run
  your app with multiple initial states, which makes it ideal for starting apps
  in the middle of other flows, or to test specific scenarios.

* Fix bug where TTY was not restored from RAW mode during normal shutdown.

* Now the `Event.Frame time` event includes the frame time, and all examples
  are updated to work with it.

* Add new `Hide_cursor` and `Show_cursor` commands, and always restore the
  cursor to visible on exit

#### Leaves

* New `Leaves.Fps` to specify a frame rate and cap updates at that rate (Thanks
  to @sabine)

* New `Leaves.Sprite` module to create frame-based animations that are ticked
  at a specific frame-rate (Thanks to @sabine)

* New `Leaves.Spinner` contains several spinners ready to be used in
  applications (Thanks to @sabine)

* New `Leaves.Text_input` field ready to be used in applications (Thanks to
  @lessp_)

* New `Leaves.Cursor` that can be used to highlight where the cursor is in a
  given text (Thanks to @nguermond)

* Reworked `Leaves.Progress` to support plain and gradient progress bars with
  customizable empty/full/trail characters, and to fit right into the
  make/update/view pattern.

#### Spices

* Implemented support for gradients between two RGB colors

#### Examples

* New Spinners example showcasing several spinners (Thanks to @sabine)

* New Emojis game example showcasing a tilemap and moving a player around
